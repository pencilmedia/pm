    <div id="faq-question">
	<span id="1"></span>How much money will I save with
      SFPCU Auto Buying Service?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer"> You will not only save money on your next vehicle (due
      to our buying power), but you will avoid the hassle dealerships are known
      for. We work for you on your behalf and in your interest. </div>
    <div id="faq-question">
	<span id="2"></span>How much do you charge for your
      Service?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer"> This is a free member benefit for all SFPCU members.
      If you are interested in applying for a membership <a href="http://www.sfpcu.org/membership/m_howtojoin.html">click
      here</a>.</div>
    <div id="faq-question">
	<span id="3"></span>What vehicles do you sell?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer"><em>Any Make. Any Model.</em> We can acquire any new
      vehicle that is sold; from an Acura to a Ferrari and everything in between &ndash; including
      SUV&rsquo;s, family and cargo vans, and fully equipped work trucks. We
      can also procure you a quality pre-owned vehicle.</div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="4"></span>Do you take trade-ins?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">Yes. We will get you the most for your trade-in because
      we shop your trade-in to wholesalers and re-marketers who pay top market
      value. </div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="5"></span>What type of inventory do you
      have?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">We have no inventory at our office location; this is
      what allows us to save you money, by taking advantage of our low overhead.
      We have access to every vehicle at or even on route to any dealership in
      the U.S</div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="6"></span>Do you only serve clients in
      the Bay Area?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer"> We provide remote service to SFPCU members who reside
      outside of the Bay Area.</div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="7"></span>What type of financing rates
      do you offer? </div>
    <div id="faq-answer">SFPCU financing can be your best resource &mdash; often
      better than direct factory financing plus you don&rsquo;t need to give
      up your rebate (when one is available on your particular new vehicle).
      We are the best choice for your next auto loan. A variety of attractive
      financing options are available (please see <a href="../advantage/index.asp">SFPCU
      Advantage</a>). </div>
    <div id="faq-question"><span id="8"></span>What about factory incentives?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">All factory incentives will be applied if these promotions
      are available on the vehicle you are purchasing. </div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="9"></span>What about hard to locate vehicles?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">Not a problem. We can find it! We specialize in local,
      statewide, regional, and nationwide searches for hard to find cars. We
      will exercise every possible resource we have to locate the exact car you
      want. </div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="10"></span>Where do I take my car when I
      need warranty repair?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">At the dealer of your choice. Remember, every new car
      carries the full manufacturer&rsquo;s factory warranty, and can be serviced
      at any dealership. </div>
    <div id="faq-question"> <span id="11"></span>What about servicing my car?</div>
    <div id="faq-answer">You can service your vehicle at the dealer of your choice
      and receive excellent service. After a service or warranty repair manufacturers
      and dealerships themselves will send you a comment form to assess the level
      of service you received. These satisfaction reports are important to the
      manufacturer and give you the member a say in how you are treated. <br />
    </div>
    <div id="faq-question"><span id="12"></span>What are the disadvantages of
      working with SFPCU Personal Auto Buying Service </div>
    <div id="faq-answer">There are none! You purchase your vehicle with such
      ease that you will be baffled at the process; this is how the auto buying
      service conducts business. It is constantly growing by word of mouth referrals
      from our satisfied members. </div>
